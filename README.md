New York Times Search it's project with GA, It's all about HTML pages, styling with CSS and also JavaScript and jQuery . In this project, I create one HTML pages index.html it's the landeing page, one file for styling style.css and one file for javascript main.js.

# Introduction to the project

The New York Times is an American newspaper based in New York City with worldwide influence and readership. Founded in 1851, the paper has won 127 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper.In this project, I used the Article Search API to look up articles by keyword like web_url, snippet, lead_paragraph,source and section_name. You can refine your search using filters and facets.

# Usage
- jQuery: Is a javaScript library. To setup, your code with jQuery library put this code in the <body> of HTML page.

- style.css:it is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. To setup, your code with style.css library put this code in the <head> of HTML page. Also I add some Icons in this project like ```fa fa-newspaper-o``` , ```fa fa-search``` and ```fa fa-trash```, I put that code in the <head> of HTML page
 
    ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles1.css" >```
    ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">```
