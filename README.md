# Project Name
New York Times Articles

# Instructions
New York Times Articles it's project with GA, It's all about HTML pages, styling with CSS and also JavaScript and jQuery . In this project, I create one HTML pages ``index.html`` it's the landeing page, one file for styling ``style.css`` and one file for javascript ``main.js``.

# Introduction to the project
The New York Times is an American newspaper based in New York City with worldwide influence and readership. Founded in 1851, the paper has won 127 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper.In this project, I used the Article Search API to look up articles by keyword.  You can get useful results from the Article Search API with a simple query like `web_url`, `snippet`, `lead_paragraph`, `source`, `section_name`, `begin_date` and `end_date`. 


# Usage
- jQuery: Is a javaScript library. To setup, your code with jQuery library put this code in the <body> of HTML page.

  ``` <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script> ```

- style.css:it is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. To setup, your code with style.css library put this code in the <head> of HTML page. Also I add some icons in this project like ```fa fa-newspaper-o``` , ```fa fa-search``` and ```fa fa-trash```, and I put that code in the <head> of HTML page.
  
    ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles1.css" >```
    
   ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">```
